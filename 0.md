0.sec=Greetings!  Welcome to my little list of links regarding Data Privacy.  First a word on my perspective.  Privacy can most effectively be implemented in a P2P data model. This is the vision of "identity" technologies such as Kantara UMA.  This seems to be the intended impact of the EU GDPR.  With that as forward, a few resources:

1.sec=The IACCM "Contract Principle" regarding Data Security.  Background and a recommended clause: <a href="index.php?action=doc&file=G/IACCM-ContractPrinciples-CmA/DataSecurity/0.md">G/IACCM-ContractPrinciples-CmA/DataSecurity/0.md</a>

2.sec=The data protection provisions of a form of Master Services Agreement.  Data must be protected along the chain of control.  Here are some general provisions.  These should be made consistent with the GDPR and should be compared with the IACCM Principle.  (It would be interesting to do a version that reflecte a privacy-preserving approach.)  From a GE Power MSA: <a href="index.php?action=doc&file=G/Agt-MasterService-CmA/Sec/PersonalData/0.md">G/Agt-MasterService-CmA/Sec/PersonalData/0.md</a>

3.sec=The terms of for Kantara UMA: <a href="index.php?action=doc&file=G/Kantara-UMA-Text-CmA/0.md">G/Kantara-UMA-Text-CmA/0.md</a>

4.sec=The GDPR formatted as a prose object: <a href="index.php?action=source&file=index.php?action=source&file=G/EU-GDPR-Law-CmA/Form/0.md">G/EU-GDPR-Law-CmA/Form/0.md</a>

5.sec=A "Privacy Policy" for Acme, done by refactoring the GDPR prose object.  This is an example of a ProseChain.  A ProseChain connects the "end-user" (aka citizen) via a company's terms to a broader legal community's view (e.g., model terms or legislation).  It systematizes text "provenance": <a href="index.php?action=doc&file=G/EU-GDPR-Law-CmA/Demo/Acme_UK.md">G/EU-GDPR-Law-CmA/Demo/Acme_UK.md</a>
